## Project Information

Welcome to Egbot! This website is part of a research project interested
in how examples are used mathematical research(<a href="https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/automating-human-like-example-use-in-mathematics" target="_blank">LINK</a>). We are curious
whether we can create a machine which would be able to participate in
mathematical conversations in a meaningful way. The purpose of this website
is to generate examples based on a search query that a user provides.
We are using a machine learning model trained on the data from mathstackexchange(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IGQnW_WT9LOiR69kUilRUCcUbGwbR_JHCxnyNiAkU9I/" target="_blank">LINK</a>).
Try exploring the website by clicking on various mathematical fields below.
Also please provide feedback to the examples generated so we can improve them!
We also provide links to related questions on mathstackexchange, so feel free
to use them if our generated answer is not sufficient. Hopefully this website
will be of use to you and feedback is always appreciated. Enjoy the website and if you
wish to contact us, you can email us at pkuzmickas@dundee.ac.uk
